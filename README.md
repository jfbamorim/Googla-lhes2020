# Googla-lhes2020
Final project for Java Concurrent and Distributed Programming

Project to emulate the behaviour of google.

The purpose was to create a application in Java, with GUI (Java Swing), in order to search in several files for a word.

Let's assume we have twenty files on our system and we want to search for "fireman" word in all files.

In this application, we will create threads to deal with the files search and then retrieve all the files and occurences of the "fireman" word.

Then, in the GUI interface the program will show all the files that have at least one occurence of the word we were looking for.
